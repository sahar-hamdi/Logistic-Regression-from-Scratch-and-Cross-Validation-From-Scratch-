# Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch-and-Cross-Validation-From-Scratch-
1. Load MNIST dataset. 2. Subset your data to use only class 0 and class1 for the next steps. 3. Standardize your dataset 4. Divide data into training and validation set using 10-fold cross validation method 5. Implement Logistic Regression with different values for learning rate 6. Report difference accuracy for the different learning rate.
